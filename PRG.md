**Pseudo-Random Number Generators**

A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), sometimes called a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), is an algorithm for generating a sequence of numbers that approximates the properties of random numbers. PRNGs are crucial in many areas of computing, including but not limited to, simulations, statistical sampling, computer programming, and cryptography.

Despite appearing to be random, these sequences of numbers are completely determined by an initial value called the seed. Given the same seed, a PRNG will always produce the same sequence of numbers. This predictability distinguishes pseudo-random numbers from "true" random numbers, which are not predictable or repeatable.

**General Operation of a PRNG**

The simplest form of a PRNG is the linear congruential generator, where each number in the sequence is generated by multiplying the previous number by a constant, adding another constant, and then taking the remainder when divided by a third constant. Despite the simplicity, this method can generate numbers that appear fairly random and has been widely used for many years.

However, a PRNG for use in a cryptographic context must be more sophisticated, as the sequences it generates need to be unpredictable. For this purpose, cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators (CSPRNGs) are employed.

**Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generators (CSPRNGs)**

CSPRNGs have properties that make them suitable for use in cryptography, where high-quality randomness is required. They satisfy two main properties:

1. **Next-bit Unpredictability:** Given the first k bits of a random sequence, the k+1 bit is unpredictable and independent of the first k bits.
   
2. **Backtracking Resistance:** Given the first k bits of a random sequence, it should be infeasible to predict the bits prior to the kth bit, even if all k bits are known.

Several well-known algorithms exist for generating cryptographically secure pseudo-random numbers, including the Fortuna algorithm, the Yarrow algorithm, and the CryptGenRandom algorithm used by Microsoft's CryptoAPI.

**Application in Cryptography**

PRNGs are essential in cryptography. They are used in key generation, random nonces, salt values in hash functions, and for blinding during certain cryptographic operations. 

For instance, in public key cryptography systems like RSA, PRNGs are used to generate large prime numbers as part of the key. Also, in symmetric key cryptography systems like AES, PRNGs are used to generate a unique key for each session.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**

The main strength of PRNGs lies in their determinism and efficiency. They can generate long sequences of "random" numbers very quickly, and these sequences can be reproduced if the seed is known. This makes PRNGs ideal for simulations and modeling, where repeatability is often necessary.

However, this strength is also a weakness. If an attacker can guess or determine the seed used by a PRNG, they can predict all the numbers in the sequence. This predictability can be a serious security flaw in cryptographic applications if not properly addressed.

**Conclusion**

While pseudo-random number generators are a critical component in various fields of computer science, they are of paramount importance in cryptography. Ensuring the proper implementation of PRNGs and maintaining their security through techniques such as seeding with true random numbers is essential for secure communication.
