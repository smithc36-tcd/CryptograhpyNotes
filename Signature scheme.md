# Construction
A digital signature scheme is a method for verifying the authenticity of digital messages or documents. It typically involves three algorithms: key generation, signing, and verification.

1. **Key Generation**: This is an algorithm that produces a pair of keys, a private signing key and a public verification key.

2. **Signing**: Given a message and a private signing key, this algorithm produces a signature.

3. **Verification**: Given the message, the signature, and the public verification key, this algorithm checks the authenticity of the signature.

When a signature, message, and public key pass the verification algorithm, we can be confident that the message was signed using the corresponding private key.

Signature schemes should satisfy two properties: correctness and security. Correctness means that any signature generated by the signing algorithm should be verifiable. Security usually involves a stronger property called unforgeability, which leads us to your second question.

## Existential Unforgeability

Existential unforgeability is a property of digital signature schemes that essentially means it is computationally infeasible for an attacker to forge a signature for any message, even if they've seen signatures on other messages. This is a stronger security requirement than simple unforgeability, which just requires that the attacker can't forge a signature on a specific given message.

Existential unforgeability is typically defined in terms of a game between an attacker and a challenger. The challenger generates a key pair and gives the public key to the attacker. The attacker can then ask for signatures on messages of their choosing. Despite this, they must not be able to produce a valid signature on a new message (one they haven't asked the challenger to sign).

**Definition:** A signature scheme $(Gen, sig, Verif)$ is secure against existential forgeries if for every polynomial time algorithm and a random key pair Gen($1^n$)$\to$(pk, sk), $$
\Pr[A^{Sig_{sk}(\cdot)}(pk) = (m, \sigma) \land Verif_{pk}(m, \sigma) = 1\ \land \forall i : m \neq m_i]
$$ is negligible where $m_i$ is the ith query to $Sig_{sk}(\cdot)$. 

This property is important because without it, an attacker could potentially use valid signatures to create fraudulent messages. For example, in a system that didn't have existential unforgeability, an attacker who saw a valid signature on a low-value transaction might be able to use it to forge a signature on a high-value transaction.
