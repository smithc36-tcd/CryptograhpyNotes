## Ciphertext only attack 
In this method, the cryptanalyst has access only to the ciphertext (the encrypted message). The goal is to deduce the plaintext or the key used to encrypt the message. This is the most common type of attack and also the hardest, as it requires a deep understanding of the encryption algorithm and possibly a large amount of ciphertext.

## Known plaintext attack
Here, the cryptanalyst has access to both the plaintext (the original message) and its corresponding ciphertext. The goal is to find the key used in the encryption process. This type of attack was common during World War II, when cryptanalysts often had access to both the plaintext and ciphertext of intercepted messages.

## Chosen plaintext attack
In this method, the cryptanalyst can choose arbitrary plaintexts to be encrypted and then has access to the corresponding ciphertexts. The goal is to find the key used in the encryption process. This type of attack is often used in the process of developing new cryptographic algorithms, to test their security.

## Chosen Ciphertext attack
Here, the cryptanalyst can choose arbitrary ciphertexts to be decrypted and then has access to the corresponding plaintexts. The goal is to find the key used in the encryption process. This is a powerful type of attack that can be used against some types of cryptographic algorithms.
